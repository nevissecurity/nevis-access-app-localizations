# Nevis Access App Localizations

This repository contains the base localizations .csv file for the [Nevis Access App](https://docs.nevis.net/nevisaccessapp/) which contains all translation keys and default values for all supported languages.
Nevis supplies standard translations of all app messages.


The `localizations.csv` is used in our [Ordering an Access app](https://docs.nevis.net/nevisaccessapp/ordering-an-access-app) process when a customer orders a branded Access application. For more information about the purpose of `localizations.csv` file and its structure read the corresponding [chapter](https://docs.nevis.net/nevisaccessapp/ordering-an-access-app#localizations).

The purpose of publication of `localizations.csv` file is to ease to follow its changes for the customers. At every new release of the Nevis Access application a new `localizations.csv` will be published and tagged, this way newly introduced translation keys and modified values for existing transation keys can be easily checked in history.

# Custom translations

In case no specific, custom values are defined (per translation key), the default translations will be used.
When providing custom translations, only *changed* translation key-value entries must be supplied.

Provide the changed `localizations.csv` file via the [Nevis Portal Ticketing System](https://portal.nevis.net/).
Keep the formatting of the file in place. Every entry must be comma separated and enclosed with `"`.
We cannot accept spreadsheet files like Microsoft Excel.
