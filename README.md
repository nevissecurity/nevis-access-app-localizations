# Nevis Access Application Localizations

This repository contains the base localization file of our Nevis Access application that contains all transaltion keys and default values for all supported languages.

The `localizations.csv` is used in our [Ordering an Access app](https://docs.nevis.net/nevisaccessapp/ordering-an-access-app) process when a customer orders a branded Access application. For more information about the purpose of `localizations.csv` file and its structure read the corresponding [chapter](https://docs.nevis.net/nevisaccessapp/ordering-an-access-app#localizations).

The purpose of publication of `localizations.csv` file is to ease to follow its changes for the customers. At every new release of the Nevis Access application a new `localizations.csv` will be published and tagged, this way newly introduced translation keys and modified values for existing transation keys can be easily checked in history.
